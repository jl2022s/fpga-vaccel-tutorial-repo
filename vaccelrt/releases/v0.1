# VaccelRT v0.1

We release the alpha version of VaccelRT. This version includes the core runtime
and back-end plugins for jetson inference and virtio.

## Notes

1. The API exposed at the moment is a very simplistic subset of image operators
and a simple matrix-matrix multiplication. The API we expose will be enriched
and become more oriented to real-world applications.
